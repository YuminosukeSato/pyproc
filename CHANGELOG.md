# Changelog

All notable changes to pyproc will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2025-08-15

### Added

#### Core Features
- **Worker Pool Implementation** - Production-ready pool with round-robin load balancing
- **Process Management** - Robust worker lifecycle management with automatic restarts
- **Connection Pooling** - Persistent connections for improved performance
- **Health Monitoring** - Periodic health checks with automatic recovery
- **Backpressure Control** - Semaphore-based request limiting to prevent overload

#### API
- `NewPool()` - Create and configure worker pools
- `Pool.Start()` - Initialize all workers in the pool
- `Pool.Call()` - Execute Python functions with automatic load balancing
- `Pool.Shutdown()` - Graceful shutdown with resource cleanup
- `Pool.Health()` - Get current health status of all workers

#### Protocol
- JSON-RPC style messaging over Unix Domain Sockets
- 4-byte length header framing for reliable message boundaries
- Request/Response correlation with unique IDs
- Error propagation from Python to Go

#### Python Worker
- `@expose` decorator for function registration
- Automatic health endpoint
- Structured logging support
- Graceful shutdown handling

#### Documentation
- Comprehensive README with quick start guide
- Architecture design document (docs/design.md)
- Operations guide (docs/ops.md)
- Security best practices (docs/security.md)

#### Testing
- Unit tests for all core components
- Integration tests for Go-Python communication
- Pool functionality tests with TDD approach
- Benchmark suite for performance validation

#### Benchmarks
- Single worker vs pool performance comparison
- Parallel request handling benchmarks
- Latency percentile measurements (p50, p95, p99)
- Throughput testing with various payload sizes

#### DevOps
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- golangci-lint configuration
- Makefile with common tasks (demo, test, bench, lint)
- Apache 2.0 license

### Performance
- Single worker: ~4,000 req/s
- 4 workers: ~15,000 req/s
- 8 workers: ~22,000 req/s
- Latency p50: 45μs, p95: 89μs, p99: 125μs

### Known Issues
- Workers may take time to stabilize on startup
- Socket cleanup may leave stale files on ungraceful shutdown
- Python GIL still limits single worker performance

## Migration Guide

### From Development to v0.1.0

If you were using the pre-release version, update your code:

#### Before (single worker):
```go
worker := pyproc.NewWorker(cfg, nil)
worker.Start(ctx)
```

#### After (with pool):
```go
pool, _ := pyproc.NewPool(pyproc.PoolOptions{
    Config: pyproc.PoolConfig{
        Workers:     4,
        MaxInFlight: 10,
    },
    WorkerConfig: cfg,
}, nil)
pool.Start(ctx)
```

### Python Worker Updates

No changes required for Python workers. The `@expose` decorator and worker API remain the same.
